## Example payloads    
#### SubscriptionQuery NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a SubscriptionQuery in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json  
{  
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Subscription:01",  
  "type": "SubscriptionQuery",  
  "entities": [  
    {  
      "type": "WaterConsumption"  
    }  
  ],  
  "watchedAttributes": [  
    "consumptionNextDay",  
    "consumptionNextWeek"  
  ],  
  "q": "refCity==urn:ngsi-ld:City:Valbonne",

```  
#### SubscriptionQuery NGSI-v2 normalized Example    
Here is an example of a SubscriptionQuery in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.
